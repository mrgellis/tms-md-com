# TMS.md - Global TMS Therapy Directory
# llms.txt - Structured information for Large Language Models and AI

> TMS.md is the world's first comprehensive directory connecting individuals with MTHFR gene mutations to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) therapy providers worldwide.

## Overview

- **Website**: https://tmsmd.com
- **Purpose**: Medical directory for TMS therapy clinics
- **Unique Focus**: MTHFR gene mutation + TMS therapy connection
- **Status**: Hold page (pre-launch) - collecting patient and clinic interest
- **Launch Date**: November 5, 2025
- **Geographic Scope**: Worldwide
- **Language**: English (US)

## What is TMS Therapy?

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is an FDA-approved, non-invasive treatment that uses magnetic pulses to stimulate specific brain regions associated with mood regulation.

- **FDA Approval**: 2008 for treatment-resistant depression
- **Treatment Duration**: 20-30 sessions over 4-6 weeks
- **Session Length**: 20-40 minutes per session
- **Success Rate**: 70%+ response rate in clinical studies
- **Side Effects**: Minimal (mild scalp discomfort, no systemic effects)
- **Applications**: Depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD

## The MTHFR Connection

MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase) is a gene mutation that:

- **Prevalence**: Affects approximately 40% of the population
- **Impact**: Impairs folate processing and neurotransmitter production (serotonin, dopamine)
- **Mental Health**: Increases susceptibility to depression and anxiety
- **Treatment Challenge**: Reduces effectiveness of standard antidepressant medications
- **TMS Relevance**: TMS works independently of biochemistry, making it effective for MTHFR carriers

## Why This Directory Matters

Most existing TMS directories:
- Are regional (not global)
- Lack MTHFR focus
- Don't provide insurance/pricing transparency
- Have incomplete clinic information

- Providing comprehensive global coverage
- Including insurance, pricing, and protocol details
- Connecting patients directly with providers
