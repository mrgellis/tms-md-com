## 📋 GLOBAL STANDARDS REFERENCE

This project follows universal development standards defined in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, including:
- Session continuity protocol with timestamped handovers
- Documentation efficiency standards
- Universal verification protocol
- Code quality and performance standards

## 🎯 PROJECT PURPOSE

### Problem We're Solving
- MTHFR gene mutations affect 40% of the population
- These mutations can impair neurotransmitter production, increasing susceptibility to depression/anxiety
- Standard antidepressants often don't work for MTHFR carriers
- TMS therapy is an effective drug-free alternative, but finding clinics is difficult
- No comprehensive, MTHFR-focused TMS directory exists

### Our Solution
A global directory that:
- Lists verified TMS therapy clinics worldwide
- Provides insurance, pricing, and protocol information
- Educates about MTHFR-TMS connection
- Connects patients to appropriate providers

## 🏗️ TECHNICAL STACK

- **Framework**: React 19.1.1
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.2.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.8.3
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.18
- **Package Manager**: Bun 1.2
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **Forms**: Netlify Forms (2 forms: patient waitlist + clinic interest)
- **Analytics**: Google Tag Manager (GTM placeholder ready)
